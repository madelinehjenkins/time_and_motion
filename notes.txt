1) App crashes when not connected to network and trying to upload, even though this is done within a try-catch block of Qstats
2) Next, Skip, and Find all seem to have different timestamp formats; and Next seems to use time 0 (i.e. 1970)

a) to attach access the local sqlite3 database in the emulator, go:

adb -s emulator-5554 shell

then:
root@generic:/ # sqlite3 /data/data/org.gheskio.queue/databases/SimpleQDB.db

useful command-lines for creating QRcodes:

# make a bigger one with ten dots instead of default 3
qrencode -s 10 -o /home/cgn/public_html/qrcodes/newfoo.png 000123456

# add a visible title to the top
convert fooqrbig.png -gravity North -background White -splice 0x18 -pointsize 30 -annotate +0+10 '00012345' annofoo.png

# put a bunch together on a page
montage -geometry 256x256+2+2 anno-1.png anno-2.png anno-3.png anno-0.png montage.png

# put a bunch of pages together into a single PDF
convert montage1.png montage2.png montage3.png combined.pdf

Simulator

we want to simulate what the events might be from a variety of workers at a variety of stations, with various arrival queues and upload times.

So we'd need threads for:

workers
patients

and objects for facilities and locations within that facility. So first, let's create a property sheet for
facilities.location, and then a bunch of workers we can allocate to them, or rather, just automagically spawn a
worker, and patients, at each.  We start with a random arrival time interval, and a constant drain frequency.

The current key for signing things is gheskio_key4; and the PW is: "stop_HIV_now!"
